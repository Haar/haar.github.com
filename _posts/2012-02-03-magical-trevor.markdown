[Magical Trevor is back, once again...](http://weebls-stuff.com/songs/magical+trevor+4/ "Magical Trevor 4")

So I've decided to start again with my blog, previously seen on www.robert-white.me.uk in 2010 (not that anyone cares, but for personal consistancy I have to write this. I shall hopefully be blogging on some interesting topics, mainly [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and a series of testing tools and styles.

My next post however will be on my week at [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.co.uk), and the experiences involved with it.
