### The Student

Today is the first week of the new semester, and the modules are [Computer Security and Forensics](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/modules/level3/com3501.html), [The Intelligent Web](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/modules/level3/com3504.html) and [Adaptive Intelligence](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/modules/level3/com3240.html). Two of my three lecturers seem to be the most engaging with the class I have had so far at University, and I really appreciate their efforts to captivate the attention and focus of the class.

I recently attended the [ShRUG](http://shrug.org/) talk by my friend and coursemate [Tom Crayford](http://www.tcrayford.net/) on [Isolation vs Rails](http://shrug.org/meetings/shrug-27/), a subject which I'm interested in based on my sometimes frustrating experience with Spork as an attempt to speed up my tests. Finally, I thoroughly recommend a screencast I've recently started following, [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts).

### The Teacher

On the other end of the spectrum, one of my fellow students undertaking the same dissertation projects is He Hui Lim. Whilst we are both undertaking the same project, the tools and methodologies we employ differ greatly; with myself implementing the project in Ruby on Rails using Test-Driven Development, and him using the PHP Framework CodeIgniter. As well as having differing opinions on what the final goal to be achieved is, the methods incorporated in producing the commonalities between the two processes vary greatly, and I find myself actively explaining the reasoning behind my design decisions, and demonstrating the typical feature development process involved to do so.

Another one of my coursemates is Guneet Gil, somewhat similar to the activities with He Hui; we worked through Conways Game of Life in a pure TDD cycle, using Ruby and Rspec as our development language and testing framework to accelerate the process. Hopefully they have both benefited from our time spent together and I'd thoroughly enjoy doing something similar in future. Who knows, maybe they'll finally come along to a [CodeRetreat](http://coderetreat.com/) too!
